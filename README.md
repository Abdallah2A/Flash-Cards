# Flash Cards
The Flash Cards application is a simple tool designed to help users learn and practice vocabulary in a foreign language. It presents users with flashcards containing words in the target language (e.g., French) on one side and their translations in the native language (e.g., English) on the other side. Users can test their knowledge by flipping the cards and attempting to recall the translations.

## Description
The Flash Cards application is built using Python and Tkinter. It loads a dataset of words and their translations from a CSV file and displays them on virtual flashcards. Users can flip the cards to reveal the translations and mark their responses as correct or incorrect. The application tracks the user's progress and removes correctly answered words from the dataset, allowing users to focus on words they need to learn.

## Features
